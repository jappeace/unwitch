Removes the magic from witch.
This provides safe conversions like witch does.
But it [doesn't use type classes](https://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes.html)
or exceptions.
This has a couple of advantages:

1. No need to use type application for function selection.
2. Functions get names that describe what they do.
   This allows ctags to work as well.
3. No trouble with orphans.
4. Custom errors instead of the prelude based ones allow client
   code to recover with typesafety even on partial conversions.
   
## Usage

The idea is to select some module *from* which type you want to convert.
So if you have a double you do:

```haskell
import qualified Unwitch.Convert.Double as Double

```
Next you simply use the functions within the module
to convert to something you want, for example:

```haskell
spec = do
  Double.toFloat 5.6 `shouldBe` 5.6
```

Although dubious since float holds less information
then double,
this can never fail in the current implementation.
But there are situation where conversion can fail,
such as when converting to an integer:
```haskell
spec = do
  Double.toInteger 5.0 `shouldBe` Right 5
  Double.toInteger 5.6 `shouldBe` Left $ RationalConversion $ DenomNotOne (5 % 6)
```

In these situation you'll `Right` for success, or `Left`
for an error.
The library will attempt to give you as much information
as possible,
in this case the denominator wasn't 1 so the rational
conversion failed.

## Comparison 

### Witch

Type applications are unnecessary because there is no polymorphism.
Since there are no polymorphic types we don't need to distinct
between conversions that fail and conversions that don't,
This is encoded in types.
Furthermore on failure, if the client can figure out how to go on with a
Rational, they can.
In witch this information gets squashed, we happily provide it.
It's not an exception like witch implied.


## Hacking
### Tools
Enter the nix shell.
```
nix-shell
```
You can checkout the makefile to see what's available:
```
cat makefile
```

### Running
```
make run
```

### Fast filewatch which runs tests
```
make ghcid
```

## Design decisions

+ Modules names indicate where you're converting *from*.
+ Errors should be packed with information to allow recovery
+ Only restricted to primitives in base.
  The original witch had support for Map, and Text.
  I feel this is out of scope.
